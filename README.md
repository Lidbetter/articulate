## What is Articulate?

Articulate is a data source agnostic entity mapper.

## Why Articulate?

Traditional ORMs have a lot of magic, and introduce their own limitations or specific ways of working.
It doesn't take long before you need to do something that your ORM of choice doesn't do, and you have
to find a way to perform your given task, within their confines. 

Articulates entities would be domain specific and their resemblance to the database is entirely down to
your own preferences. Structure your data using entities, without the overhead of passing around the 
entire DBAL.
